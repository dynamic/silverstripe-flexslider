## Overview

The FlexSlider module allows a developer to attach a [Woothemes FlexSlider](https://github.com/woothemes/FlexSlider) to a Page or DataObject. Various options are built into the DataExtension to allow for some level of customization in the CMS.

## Requirements

* [silverstripe/silverstripe-framework](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-framework) ^4.0

## Installation

`composer require dynamic/flexslider ^4.0`

## Documentation

See the [docs/en](docs/en/index.md) folder.

## Troubleshooting

- I've applied the `FlexSlider` DataExtension to a DataObject or Page and am receiving errors.
  - Be sure you have run a `dev/build?flush=all`
  - If this is an existing site installation and `FlexSlider` is being applied to existing records, be sure to run `dev/tasks/SlideThumbnailNavMigrationTask`. This will ensure default values expected for the module are setup for the existing records.
