[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dynamic/SilverStripe-FlexSlider.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/dynamic/SilverStripe-FlexSlider)

Overview
=======================

The FlexSlider module allows a developer to attach a [woothemes flexslider](https://github.com/woothemes/FlexSlider) to a Page or DataObject. Various FlexSlider options are built into the DataExtension to allow for some level of customization.

Composer Installation
=======================

`"require": { "dynamic/silverstripe-flexslider" }`

Add `flexslider` to your `.gitignore`

Git Installation
=======================

`git clone https://github.com/dynamic/SilverStripe-FlexSlider.git flexslider`

Requirements
=======================

* [silverstripe/silverstripe-framework](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-framework) 3.1.x

Recommended Add-Ons
=======================

* [colymba/gridfiel-dbulk-editing-tools](https://github.com/colymba/GridFieldBulkEditingTools)
* [undefinedoffset/sortablegridfield](https://github.com/UndefinedOffset/SortableGridField)

Usage
=======================

In your `mysite/_config/config.yml` add the following to the desired page type or DataObject you wish to add the flexslider to:

```
Page:
  extensions:
    - FlexSlider
Page_Controller:
  extensions:
    - FlexSliderExtension
```

Alternatively you could add the following to your `mysite/_config.php` file: ```Page::add_extension('FlexSlider');```

After attaching the DataExtension to your page type or DataObject run a `dev/build` then `?flush=all`. You should now see a "Slides" tab on the page type or DataObject you applied the DataExtension to. You can now add Slides that will be looped through in your layout by using the `FlexSlider` include.
`<% include FlexSlider %>`
